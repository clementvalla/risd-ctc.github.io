            <h5>Pathways</h5>
             <p>CTC is open to all undergraduate students. Students will typically decide to become concentrators
               toward the end of their first-year or in their sophomore year. However, it is also possible to begin the concentration in the junior year.
               Students will be eligible to officially become concentrators once they have enrolled in a required introductory course.
               Currently, this is <em>Introduction to Computation</em>, which runs in the Fall, Wintersession, and Spring terms. Upon gaining entry into this course,
               interested students will sign a concentration declaration form and submit this to the CTC Coordinator. Copies will be sent to the Registrar and the student’s Department
               Head. From this point, students can maintain their status as concentrators for their remaining time at RISD, provided they remain in good academic standing with a B- or above in CTC courses.
               There is no penalty for not completing or withdrawing from the concentration, other than the CTC concentration will have not been achieved.</p>
               <p>Students who have taken eligible electives prior to <em>Introduction to Computation</em> must still take it.
                However, students can petition the CTC Coordinator to substitute an elective for this requirement.
                The CTC Coordinator will determine if the alternative course sufficiently meets the introductory requirements.
                Students may find themselves in this position due to a number of factors including schedule conflicts, a late decision about becoming a concentrator,
                or other individual circumstances. Alternative courses could potentially come from CTC-sponsored or Department-sponsored offerings, and Brown University.
              </p>
              <p>CTC allows students to create their own pathway across identified courses throughout the College.
              Each year, a course catalog is generated in order to provide a list of all recognized CTC courses.
              This provides a guide for students as they register for the 9 credits of CTC electives.
              Students can make a request to the CTC Coordinator to recognize courses that are not included in the catalog.
              This could occur due to late announcements, new courses, or if students take related courses at Brown.</p>
              <p>In order to complete the concentration, students must take and successfully pass a required advanced course which features a large-scale project.
              Currently, this course is <em>Computation, Technology, and Culture: Research Studio</em>.
              Typically,this course will be taken in a student’s senior year though eligibility for this course comes after the student has completed 12 credits for CTC.
            <ul>
              <li>3 credits:  Introduction to Computation or an approved alternative</li>
              <li>9 credits: CTC electives or approved alternatives</li>
            </ul>
            Exceptions can be made in rare circumstances for admission to the advanced course prior to completing 12 credits.
            The primary reason this might be necessary is due to scheduling. For instance, a student might need to take a CTC elective and the advanced course in the same semester.
</p>
<h5>Additional policies</h5>
<p>
  <ul>
<li> The CTC Coordinator makes the final decision regarding whether or not courses beyond those listed in the CTC catalog meet standards and can be used as alternatives.</li>
<li> Double-counting courses for majors or other concentrations is allowable, as long as the courses in question have been identified as being eligible for CTC credit or are approved alternatives.</li>
<li> Students must receive a B- or above for any course they wish to count toward the CTC concentration.
  The B- or above condition is also necessary to maintain status as a concentrator. Lower grades will prompt a meeting between the student and the CTC Coordinator, who may advise the student to withdraw from the concentration.</li>
<li> Transfer credits from other colleges/universities are generally not eligible for CTC credit.
  Students may petition the CTC Coordinator for a transfer credit that is already recognized by RISD following <a href="http://www.risd.edu/Policies/Academic/Transfer_Credit_Undergraduate/" target="_blank">established policy</a>. </li>
<li> Status as a CTC concentrator does not provide a mechanism for placement in Brown University courses.
  Brown courses require cross-registration as per <a href="http://www.risd.edu/Policies/Academic/Brown_Cross_Registration/" target="_blank">established policy</a>.  </li>
<li> The CTC Coordinator provides academic advising related to CTC, and is available for individual meetings to discuss course options.
  Throughout the year, the CTC Coordinator also convenes information sessions for prospective and declared students.</li>
<li> Status as a CTC concentrator gives students priority for courses directly sponsored by CTC and the ability to register for these courses during the regular registration period via instructor permission. </li>
<li>Status as a CTC concentrator does not give priority for CTC eligible courses that are sponsored directly by Departments. Courses sponsored by Departments have their own registration policies.</li>
<li>Independent Study (ISP) or Collaborative Study Projects (CSP) may be eligible for CTC credit.
  Students must get pre-approval from the CTC Coordinator as well as follow <a href="http://www.risd.edu/Policies/Academic/Independent_Study_Projects/" target="_blank">established procedure for ISP/CSP registration</a>. </li>
<li>Internships may be eligible for CTC credit.
  Students must get pre-approval from the CTC Coordinator as well as follow <a href="http://www.risd.edu/Policies/Academic/Internships/" target="_blank">established procedure for credit-bearing internships</a>. </li>
<li>Retroactive credit: Through the development of the concentration, new CTC courses were launched in a pilot phase. The CTC course catalog certifies which courses offered previously can count retroactively toward concentration completion.
  Students that have already taken these courses will be able to apply the courses appropriately as CTC credits.</li>
