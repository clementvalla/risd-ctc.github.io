<h1>RISD</h1>
<h1>Computation, Technology, and Culture</h1>
<p>In spring of 2017, RISD will officially launch an interdisciplinary,
  15-credit undergraduate concentration in Computation, Technology, and Culture (CTC).
  Students earn credits toward the concentration by taking a mix of required courses and identified electives.
  Through the CTC concentration students gain an understanding of the ideas and techniques of writing in programming languages,
  while engaging with critical analysis, history, and theory concerning software systems, computational platforms, and associated
   technologies shaping society. Students hone their ability to write source code, author software, and program machines for making
  works of art and design. Some CTC-eligible courses are already offered.
  Students who have taken these courses prior to the official launch in 2017 will be able to count these toward CTC completion.
  Please contact the concentration coordinator, Shawn Greenlee, for the latest information: sgreenle {at} risd {dot} edu. </p>
